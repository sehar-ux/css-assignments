       <p id=cnc> Cloud Native computing: <br>
        The Cloud Nafive Compufing program prepares the students to program in open source
        technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native
        while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
        techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p><br><br><br>






        <p id='ai'>
        Artificial Intelligence: <br>
        The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the studentthrough the foundation ofthe AI
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas,
        Tensorfiow 2,0 and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
        ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.<br></p> <BR><BR>




       <p id='bc'> Blockchain:<br>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum
        andHyperledger(Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on
        frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps
        (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a
        service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.<br>
</p>

<br><br><br>
<p>Internet of things:<br>
The internet of thigns program introduces the students to open source development<br> technologies like rust, embedded rrust , webassemble,hyper,disel,google asisteant,
<br>and kubarnetes while making them efficient in devloping micro wserveices for ioT edge,ioT cloud,<br> and voice computiong for device contol.</p>
